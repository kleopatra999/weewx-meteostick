# weewx-meteostick
A weewx driver for the Smartbedded Meteostick device, based on Chris Matteri's work.
I have been unable to find a plug and play weewx driver for the Smartbedded Meteostick device, which allows access to the Davis Vantage Vue and Vantage 2 Pro wireless weather stations without the use of a Davis console or envoy  (something that is both expensive and unecessary if all you want is to put the weather data directly online). After a load of searching I found Chris's work here : https://github.com/cmatteri/CC1101-Weather-Receiver/
I am using this as a template to create a driver for weewx.
THIS WORK IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AT THIS TIME.
